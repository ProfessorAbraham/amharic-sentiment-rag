At a very young age under mysterious circumstances, Belay killed his uncle and fled to a life of fugitive with little or no contact with his immediate family for about 15 years during which time he developed traits that would help him achieve a name for himself in Ethiopian history as one of the greatest heroes who defended their country.\nIn 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia. Zeleke felt the need to defend his country and led a heroic movement against the occupation in Gojjam. Soon, he became known for being incredibly brutal among Italian generals and they fought him as hard as they could. Not only did he defeat the Italian army that was sent to destroy him, he also took into custody the army’s general and executed him by hanging.\nThe Ethiopian patriots liberated Addis Ababa on 6 May 1941 and this victory officially ended the Italian occupation. Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa on 5 May 1941 after spending the preceding five years in exile in Europe. There are no physical signs of Italian invasion in the province of Gojam largely because of Belay Zeleke's resistance. It is evident that Belay Zeleke never let the Italian troops camp anywhere in Gojjam let alone leave a legacy of any sort.\n\nHe declined the position in protest and started living life as an outlaw. Soon he was caught and sent to jail accused of being a threat to the monarchy. Some members of the nobility who protested the actions taken on the patriot and Ras Hailu of Gojam who was a well known nemesis of the emperor helped Belay Zeleke to escape during which time a police officer was killed. He was apprehended later and was executed by hanging with his brother Ejigu and 17 others who were his followers on January 12, 1945. Ras Hailu and the other nobles who helped Belay were immediately put on house arrest and their wealth confiscated by the government. His execution was bitterly received by many Ethiopians. In his honor Gojam road was named after him. Most Ethiopians admire him as a king."

    "original": "it is a music that has two meanings...\n   the first is purely romantic.  he is asking her why she is never loving him anymore.  he is saying you are not as loving and caring as before even if i know you are capable of it since you were nice to me.  If you continue that, I might leave and things will get worse even if I don't want that.\n\n  the second meaning is political.  this is song was sung in 2017 when Ethiopia was ruled by a dictatorial regime.  The lady is symbolizing the then government.  He is saying you could have been nice to me (as a representative of the citizenry of Ethiopia) but you are abusing your power.  I am the owner of the country but you are acting you are the owner and now it seems a serious confusion.  We will resolve this is very soon if you don't change your course of action"
