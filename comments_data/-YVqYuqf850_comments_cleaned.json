Now, I am grown up and have my own apartment and unfortunately here in America your neighbor usually complains when you open laud music. So, I played Dishta Gina laud on the speaker dancing and singing at the same time. So, two white American neighbors showed up at my door. I told them right away that I was sorry and that I will turn the volume down. Their answer, \"oh no we don't you to turn it down, we just want to know the name of the song.\" I invited them into my apartment and showed them the whole music video, and they start dancing with me. Just wanted to say.... THE POWER OF OUR ETHIOPIAN CULTURE!"

    "original": "Dear Non Ethiopian Listeners,\r\nI am amazed by your deep interest in Ethiopian music and for that I applaud you. In my opinion, the song went viral because of the message and the openness of TARIKU about his personal life on live TV interview. Tariku was born and grown up in the rural part of southern Ethiopia. He served in the military and fought a war in the North. Life was challenging for him when he was in the capital Addis Ababa. He worked as a day laborer and was living homeless life in the streets. Lastly, he decided to go back to his place of birth to break from the hustle and bustle of Addis Ababa . But the challenge he faced was that his people disowned him because of his gangster look with the long dread hair. He then went to local church and prayed to GOD to reveal his talent and make him somebody. Now he lives in the jungle as a farmer. He is the father of 5 kids. The meaning of his father's name [Gankisi] is \"To break bad habits.\" He is happy with his life and never complains. He is full of positive energy and exerts this magnetic power in to the crowd with laughter.\r\n\r\nDISHTA GHINE means New Year in \"ARI\" language. It is an Afro -Asiatic > Omotic>South language.\r\nHe begins the song by calling all the months and asking everybody to forgive their wrong doings and hope the New Year to brings happiness. And then he says the following verses in Amharic and translated as follows:\r\n\r\nMe and Adam( my father)\r\nYou and Eve (my bone)--he points his index finger towards his ribs[ reference to the Bible].\r\nI came naked to this world and leave with nothing.\r\nThere is no best Ethnic group/race amongst ourselves.. \r\nWhere does this Evil came from, we are all one.\r\nLook up the sky, no one washes it or cleans it but it is amazingly beautiful.\r\nIt is here on Earth that \"We do not have LOVE\".\r\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\r\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race.\r\nYou came from there, I came from there, We all came from there, We are all one(This is where he grasps his chest)\r\nWe are scattered all over the world after the fall of Babylon from God's grace.\r\nTo this day, we do not have a true love. no matter how we sing about it.\r\nWhat should we do ?\r\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\r\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race./2/\r\n\r\nIt is a dazzling, mesmerizing, inspirational, and spiritual song full of positivity that reminds everybody that \"We are created in the image of GOD.\r\n\r\nSolomon Tadesse\r\nBoston, Massachusetts"

    "original": " @cubadebesai1356  I got this from another comment of a guy named Solomon the lyrics are at the bottom the song is using 2 languages and the amharic language part of the song is below for you, -------Tariku the singer was born and grown up in the rural part of southern Ethiopia. He served in the military and fought a war in the North. Life was challenging for him when he was in the capital Addis Ababa. He worked as a day laborer and was living homeless life in the streets. Lastly, he decided to go back to his place of birth to break from the hustle and bustle of Addis Ababa . But the challenge he faced was that his people disowned him because of his gangster look with the long dread hair. He then went to local church and prayed to GOD to reveal his talent and make him somebody. Now he lives in the jungle as a farmer. He is the father of 5 kids. The meaning of his father's name [Gankisi] is \"To break bad habits.\" He is happy with his life and never complains. He is full of positive energy and exerts this magnetic power in to the crowd with laughter.\n\nDISHTA GHINE means New Year in \"ARI\" language. It is an Afro -Asiatic > Omotic>South language.\nHe begins the song by calling all the months and asking everybody to forgive their wrong doings and hope the New Year to brings happiness. And then he says the following verses in Amharic and translated as follows:\n\nMe and Adam( my father)\nYou and Eve (my bone)--he points his index finger towards his ribs[ reference to the Bible].\nI came naked to this world and leave with nothing.\nThere is no best Ethnic group/race amongst ourselves.. \nWhere does this Evil came from, we are all one.\nLook up the sky, no one washes it or cleans it but it is amazingly beautiful.\nIt is here on Earth that \"We do not have LOVE\".\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race.\nYou came from there, I came from there, We all came from there, We are all one(This is where he grasps his chest)\nWe are scattered all over the world after the fall of Babylon from God's grace.\nTo this day, we do not have a true love. no matter how we sing about it.\nWhat should we do ?\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\n\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race./2/"

    "original": "Dear Non Ethiopian Listeners,\nI am amazed by your deep interest in Ethiopian music and for that I applaud you. In my opinion, the song went viral because of the message and the openness of TARIKU about his personal life on live TV interview. Tariku was born and grown up in the rural part of southern Ethiopia. He served in the military and fought a war in the North. Life was challenging for him when he was in the capital Addis Ababa. He worked as a day laborer and was living homeless life in the streets. Lastly, he decided to go back to his place of birth to break from the hustle and bustle of Addis Ababa . But the challenge he faced was that his people disowned him because of his gangster look with the long dread hair. He then went to local church and prayed to GOD to reveal his talent and make him somebody. Now he lives in the jungle as a farmer. He is the father of 5 kids. The meaning of his father's name [Gankisi] is \"To break bad habits.\" He is happy with his life and never complains. He is full of positive energy and exerts this magnetic power in to the crowd with laughter.\n\nDISHTA GHINE means New Year in \"ARI\" language. It is an Afro -Asiatic > Omotic>South language.\nHe begins the song by calling all the months and asking everybody to forgive their wrong doings and hope the New Year to brings happiness. And then he says the following verses in Amharic and translated as follows:\n\nMe and Adam( my father)\nYou and Eve (my bone)--he points his index finger towards his ribs[ reference to the Bible].\nI came naked to this world and leave with nothing.\nThere is no best Ethnic group/race amongst ourselves.. \nWhere does this Evil came from, we are all one.\nLook up the sky, no one washes it or cleans it but it is amazingly beautiful.\nIt is here on Earth that \"We do not have LOVE\".\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race.\nYou came from there, I came from there, We all came from there, We are all one(This is where he grasps his chest)\nWe are scattered all over the world after the fall of Babylon from God's grace.\nTo this day, we do not have a true love. no matter how we sing about it.\nWhat should we do ?\nGOD judges you for what you did on earth.\n\nYou do not get salvation before God  based on your Ethnicity/race./2/\n\nIt is a dazzling, mesmerizing, inspirational, and spiritual song full of positivity that reminds everybody that \"We are created in the image of GOD.\n\nSolomon Tadesse\nBoston, Massachusetts"
